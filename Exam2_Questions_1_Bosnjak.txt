1) Why is the classical Runge–Kutta (RK4) more precise compared to forward Euler?
Forward Euler is a 1st order method, meaning error is proportional to step size h. While Runge Kutta is a 4th order method, and the error relates to h^4 (higher precision).

2) What is the goal of a least-squares fit, and under which assumption is it also a maximum likelihood estimator?
Goal: look for the best-fitting curve to a given set of points by minimizing the sum of the squares of the offsets ("the residuals") of the points from the curve.
Assumption: the measurement errors are independent and normally distributed with constant standard deviation.

3) In inverse transform sampling, how do you use a uniform random number u ~ U(0,1) to sample from a target PDF p(x).
By mapping it through the targets inverse cumulative distribution function.

4) Name one key difference between supervised and unsupervised learning.
supervised: for prediction (labeled input-output pairs to train models to predict future outcomes)
unsupervised: for exploratory analysis (unlabeled data to discover hidden patterns or structures)

5) What is “burn-in” in an MCMC chain?
To "burn-in" a chain, we discard the first n samples before we start collecting points. This gives the method time to reach its equilibrium distribution (unlikely, early points would then be presented suitably rare).

6) Why is NumPy vectorization often faster than a Python for-loop for array operations?
"Vectorization" is the process of rewriting a loop so that instead of processing a single element of an array N times, it processes for example 4 elements of the array simultaneously N/4 times (depends on hardware), while a for loop executes a command one by one.

7) What is the main advantage of the FFT over directly computing the DFT?
FFT offers higher computational speed due to reducing complexity from O(N^2) to O(N logN), which reduces the amount of necessary calculations.
